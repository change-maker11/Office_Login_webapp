# Employee-login-webapp
This App enables Office employee to create his personal account on the office website allowing him to upload pictures to server using multer framework in node.js. Afterwards the data is stored in mysql database and can later be retrieved for verification. After logging in the user can send emails through company"s email adress using nodemailer and also attach the files he want to send to client.

# Running the project
Prerequisite: My SQL cmd
1. We would need to create database and required tables in mysql required by the program.

# Major Features
1. All routes are independent and every information submitted by user is sent throught POST so that no sensitive information is leaked.<br />
2. Checks have been placed such that no wrong information , invalid dates and emails could enter backed and spoil the database. <br />
3. User need not fill whole data again if there is an error as the data is remembered and sent back with the error message.
4. Image uploads have been checked for proper format and size limits so that no false/ malicious data enters backend.<br />
5.The software provides emailing facility from the dashboard itself. Also proper formatting of subject and content could be done, If required attachments could also be placed.This eliminates need of opening the emailing service everytime thus imporving employee efficiency
